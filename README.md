# Geolocation
Allows administrative users to save geolocation data for an individual item. The plugin generates a Google map containing items with geolocation data and a web page for displaying the map. As of version 1.2, this plugin no longer requires a Google Maps key.

Added excellent Google Maps styling from snazzymaps (https://snazzymaps.com/style/21658/pirate-map)
